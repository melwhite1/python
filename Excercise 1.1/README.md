# Python Experience
## Progress
- Add.py is a simple addition file that allows users to add 2 variables together.
- Requirements.txt copies the dependencies from one virtual enviroment so you can call it in another.
- The screenshots show two virtual environments (cf-python-base and cf-python-copy), the creation requirements.txt and calling it to a new environment, and the workon function for cf-python-base.
