# Recipe Task
## Recipe Structure
I am going to use a dictionary for the recipe structures because I want to organize the name, cooking time and ingredients into key value pairs with their respective values. This will look more organized and display the most information about the recipe.

## All Recipes Structure
I am going to put all of the recipe dictionaries into a list so that I can see every recipe displayed easily. I think a list is the best option for the recipes because it is easy to display, add and remove new recipes.
